	abstract = {The amount of digital data derived from healthcare processes have increased tremendously in the last years. This applies especially to unstructured data, which are often hard to analyze due to the lack of available tools to process and extract information. Natural language processing is often used in medicine, but the majority of tools used by researchers are developed primarily for the English language. For developing and testing natural language processing methods, it is important to have a suitable corpus, specific to the medical domain that covers the intended target language. To improve the potential of natural language processing research, we developed tools to derive language specific medical corpora from publicly available text sources. n order to extract medicine-specific unstructured text data, openly available pub-lications from biomedical journals were used in a four-step process: (1) medical journal databases were scraped to download the articles, (2) the articles were parsed and consolidated into a single repository, (3) the content of the repository was de-scribed, and (4) the text data and the codes were released. In total, 93 969 articles were retrieved, with a word count of 83 868 501 in three different languages (German, English, and Spanish) from two medical journal databases Our results show that unstructured text data extraction from openly available medical journal databases for the construction of unified corpora of medical text data can be achieved through web scraping techniques.},

	abstract = {Background Psoriasis is a serious and chronic noncommunicable disease. However, the fundamental measure of disease occurrence, the incidence, has been scarcely reported globally. There are no previous studies of psoriasis incidence in Latin America. Aim To estimate the incidence rates of psoriasis in Chile during 2016 and 2017 using an administrative database, the Waiting List Repository. Methods We examined referrals of psoriasis at onset, made by physicians to dermatologists, evaluated the agreement of diagnosis, and estimated the incidence of the disease considering the eligible population at risk. Results In most cases, the referrals corresponded to incident cases of psoriasis (73.3\%; 95\% {CI}: 66.6–79.2). The national incidence rates of psoriasis were 22.1 (95\% {CI}: 21.1–23.1) and 22.7 (95\% {CI}: 21.8–23.6) per 100 000 person-years in 2016 and 2017, respectively. The most common type of psoriasis was the late-onset type. We observed a high variation in the figures throughout the country, with a range from 0.75 (95\% {CI}: 0.3–1.5) per 100 000 person-years in the Metropolitan region to 164.9 (95\% {CI}: 138.6–195.1) per 100 000 person-years in the Aysen region. Conclusion We describe for the first time the incidence of psoriasis in a Latin American country. Our findings could potentially guide collaborations to improve our global understanding of psoriasis in Latin America.},

	abstract = {Pathology reports provide valuable information for cancer registries to understand, plan and implement strategies to mitigate the impact of cancer. However, coding key information from unstructured reports is done by experts in a time-consuming manual process. Here we report an automatic deep learning-based system that recognizes tumor morphology and topography mentions from free-text and suggests codes from the International Classification of Diseases for Oncology ({ICD}-O) in Spanish. This task was done by combining an in-house annotated corpus of tumor morphology and topography mentions, with the {CANTEMIST} ({CANcer} {TExt} Mining Shared Task – tumor named entity recognition) corpus, an open source dataset annotated with tumor morphology mentions. To create a Named Entity Recognition ({NER}) model, we applied transfer learning from state-of-the-art pre-trained language models. The mentions found with this model were subsequently coded using a search engine tailored to the {ICDO} codes. Our {NER} models obtained an  F1 score of 0.86 and 0.90 for tumor morphology and topography, respectively. The overall performance of our automatic coding system achieved an accuracy at five suggestions of 0.72 and 0.65 for tumor morphology and topography, respectively. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of implementing {NLP} tools in the routine of a cancer center to extract and code valuable information from pathology reports.},

	abstract = {Word embeddings have been widely used in Natural Language Processing ({NLP}) tasks. Although these representations can capture the semantic information of words, they cannot learn the sequence-level semantics. This problem can be handled using contextual word embeddings derived from pre-trained language models, which have contributed to significant improvements in several {NLP} tasks. Further improvements are achieved when pre-training these models on domain-specific corpora. In this paper, we introduce Clinical Flair, a domain-specific language model trained on Spanish clinical narratives. To validate the quality of the contextual representations retrieved from our model, we tested them on four named entity recognition datasets belonging to the clinical and biomedical domains. Our experiments confirm that incorporating domain-specific embeddings into classical sequence labeling architectures improves model performance dramatically compared to general-domain embeddings, demonstrating the importance of having these resources available.},
